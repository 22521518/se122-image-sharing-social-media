## Overview

An image-sharing social app focused on location-based moment capture: enable users to capture, revisit, and share memories tied to places. Core experiences include per-place hubs, location-driven discovery, and emotionally resonant time-locked messages.

## Goals

- Capture memorable moments tied to place and time.
- Surface places that need attention and encourage annotations.
- Provide private-first sharing with selective public options.
- Create emotionally engaging rediscovery mechanics (time-locked postcards).

## Functional Requirements

- F1 Capture: Photo upload with automatic time/place metadata (EXIF lat/lon + timestamp), optional text and voice notes; quick camera action and gallery import.
- F2 Place Hub: Per-place view showing media, timeline, annotations, stickers/achievements; supports add/edit annotations and `Mark as complete`.
- F3 Memory Compass: UI that surfaces "unfinished" places (single-photo, no note, older-than X days) and navigates to Place Hub.
- F4 Time-locked Postcards: Compose photo+message with unlock condition (date OR revisit location) and recipient selection (self/friend); locked state persists until condition met.
- F5 Echo Timeline: Place-level layered playback with audio overlays and chronological fades.
- F6 Search & Discovery: Geo-oriented browsing (map + directional swipe), filters (date, tags, people), and nearby memories.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- NF1 Privacy & Sharing: Per-item visibility (private/friends/public), granular revoke, and recipient controls for postcards. Default: `private`.
- NF2 Performance & Scale: Mobile-first sync; incremental uploads, thumbnails, lazy media loading; map interactions perceived <200ms.
- NF3 Data & Retention: Persist EXIF, lat/lon, timestamp, annotations; export tools and user-controlled retention/export policies.
- NF4 Security & Legal: Encryption at-rest and in-transit, secure geolocation handling, explicit consent for biometric/face features, COPPA/GDPR compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria (high level)

- Users can capture media with attached location/time metadata and add a text or audio annotation.
- Place Hub displays media, annotations, achievements and allows adding notes/photos.
- Memory Compass surfaces relevant suggestions and opens Place Hub when selected.
- Time-locked Postcards can be composed, stored locked, and transition to unlocked when condition met; notifications are sent.
- Search and map browse return results filtered by the requested criteria and show thumbnails.

## Target Users / Personas

1. Casual Memory Keeper — easy capture, private map/timeline, low-friction annotation.
2. Traveler / Explorer — map-centric storytelling, postcards, offline support.
3. Social Sharer — curated place-hubs, stickers/achievements, sharing flows.
4. Archivist / Power User — bulk export, metadata access, advanced filters and API access.

Priority: Primary — Casual Memory Keepers & Travelers. Secondary — Social Sharers & Archivists.

## Success Metrics

- Adoption: % of new users who create at least one Place Hub within 14 days.
- Engagement: Average annotated places per active user / month; session length on Place Hub (median minutes).
- Completion Rate (Memory Compass): % of surfaced suggestions that receive an annotation within 7 days (pilot target: 15%).
- Postcard Interaction: % of time-locked postcards unlocked and opened within 7 days (target: 40%).
- Retention: 30-day and 90-day retention for users who used location features vs control group.
- Quality: % of media items with at least one annotation after 30 days.
- Moderation SLAs: auto-responses 24h; human review 72h.

## Content & Moderation

- Content types: Photos, short videos, text notes, voice notes, stickers, location metadata, time-locked messages.
- Automated filters: NSFW detection, hate/harassment text filters, profanity, PII detection. Audio transcription + text filtering for voice notes.
- Metadata safety: PII detection, warn and allow redaction; flag precise home addresses and private residences.
- Moderation pipeline: Tier 1 automated actions (blur/hide); Tier 2 human review; actions: remove, blur, label, restore; logging for audit.
- Postcard rules: Prevent scheduling to minors without parental consent; rate-limit scheduling; require recipient consent where required.
- Geo-safety: Warn/block posts near sensitive POIs; optional map blurring for sensitive locations.
- Privacy defaults: New captures default to `private`; easy revoke and clear unlock previews for postcards.
- Reporting & appeals: in-app reporting, status tracking, auto-responses within 24h, human review within 72h.

## Implementation Notes & Next Steps

- Define heuristics for "unfinished" places (example: single-photo, no annotation, last-updated > 90 days).
- Sketch quick prototypes for Memory Compass and Time-locked Postcards; validate with 5 users.
- Draft detailed acceptance criteria and API contracts for Capture, Place Hub, Postcards, and Moderation endpoints.
- Start with conservative moderation thresholds and privacy defaults; tune after pilot.
