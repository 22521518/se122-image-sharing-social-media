**Facilitator:** DELL
**Date:** 2025-12-18T12:00:00Z

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Image-sharing social media focused on location-based moment capture
**Goals:** Capture and revisit moments by location; enable memorization and lookback of where users went and what they did

### Context Guidance

This session will focus on:

- User Problems and Pain Points
- Feature Ideas and Capabilities
- Technical Approaches
- User Experience
- Business Model and Value
- Market Differentiation
- Technical Risks and Challenges
- Success Metrics

### Session Setup Summary

Thanks — you're building an image-sharing social app to help users record and recall moments tied to locations, so they can look back on where they've been and what they did.

**Primary goals captured:**

- Enable location-based moment capture and browsing
- Provide memorable, revisit-able timelines or maps of user activity
- Support easy photo upload, tagging, and contextual metadata (time, place, notes)

Please choose an approach for technique selection:

[1] User-Selected Techniques — I'll list techniques and you pick
[2] AI-Recommended Techniques — I suggest tailored techniques
[3] Random Technique Selection — try an unexpected method
[4] Progressive Technique Flow — start broad, then narrow

Reply with 1, 2, 3, or 4 to continue.

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** Random Technique Selection
**Selection Method:** Serendipitous discovery from the brain techniques library

**Randomly Selected Techniques:**

- **Random Stimulation (collaborative):** Use unexpected words or images as catalysts to force surprising connections — great for breaking predictable patterns when designing novel location-based interactions.

- **Metaphor Mapping (creative):** Map the product experience to a metaphor (e.g., "travel journal", "memory map") to reveal new feature metaphors and UI metaphors that make moments feel meaningful.

- **Ecosystem Thinking (biomimetic):** Treat the app as an ecosystem (places, people, photos, metadata) to uncover symbiotic features and long-term retention strategies tied to locations.

**Random Discovery Story:** A playful combination: random stimuli spark divergent ideas, metaphor mapping shapes those ideas into relatable concepts, and ecosystem thinking organizes them into product-level systems — ideal for an app seeking memorable, location-tied moments.

**Options:**

- `C` Continue — Begin facilitation using these techniques
- `Shuffle` — Randomize another combination
- `Details` — Tell me more about any specific technique
- `Back` — Return to approach selection

Please pick one of the options above (C / Shuffle / Details / Back).

## Expanded Facilitation: Random Stimulation + Metaphor Mapping

Goal: Rapidly generate surprising feature and UX concepts by forcing divergent associations (Random Stimulation) then shaping those associations into cohesive, emotionally resonant product metaphors (Metaphor Mapping). This combo keeps serendipity while producing coherent design directions for your location-based image app.

Materials:

- 20–30 random word cards or an image deck (physical or a random word/image generator)
- Whiteboard or Miro board for clustering
- Timer (10/15/20 minute intervals)
- Sticky notes or digital note cards for idea capture

Session Length: 45–75 minutes (recommended)

Facilitator Role: Keep energy high during stimulation, enforce fast cycles, then slow down and guide synthesis into metaphors and concrete feature ideas.

Step-by-step script:

1. Warm-up (5 minutes)

- Purpose: loosen thinking; brief rules: say yes to ideas, defer judgment, capture everything.
- Prompt: “We’re generating surprising connections between random stimuli and location-based moments.”

2. Random Stimulation Round (15 minutes)

- Draw 6 random cards (words/images). Display them for the group.
- For each card (2 minutes each):
  - Ask participants to write 2–3 quick ideas for how that card could map to a location-moment feature (private/quiet 60s). Examples: how could “lantern” become a moment affordance? how could “echo” be a discovery mechanic?
  - After 60s, do a 30s rapid-share: each person reads one idea aloud.
- Outcome: 12–18 raw, divergent idea snippets tied to different stimuli.

3. Rapid Clustering (10 minutes)

- Place all idea notes on board. Group by similarity or user journey stage (capture, annotate, discover, revisit).
- Facilitator highlights 3 emergent clusters that look promising for location-mapped experiences.

4. Metaphor Mapping — Choose 2 metaphors (15 minutes)

- From clusters, propose 2 product metaphors (e.g., "memory map", "travel journal", "time capsule").
- For each metaphor (7 minutes each):
  - Define the metaphor in one sentence.
  - Translate 3–5 cluster ideas into metaphor-specific features (UI/interaction language). Example: memory map → place pins that expand into day-by-day photo strips; lantern → local highlight overlays that glow when visiting a place again.
  - Capture one short user story per feature (persona + situation + benefit).

5. Synthesis & Prioritization (10 minutes)

- For each metaphor, list top 3 candidate features.
- Quick prioritization: Use 2-vote method (each participant has 2 votes). Prioritize for novelty × feasibility.
- Choose 2 features to prototype/define further.

6. Next Actions (5 minutes)

- Document chosen features as short specs: purpose, user story, success metric, quick mock note.
- Decide immediate next step (sketch wireframe, build clickable prototype, write PRD stub).

Facilitation prompts (ready-to-read):

- Random rounds: “What surprising function could this [word/image] inspire for someone revisiting a place?”
- Clustering: “Where do these ideas fit in the user’s journey—capture, annotate, rediscover, share?”
- Metaphor framing: “If our app were a [metaphor], what would the main screen be called and why?”
- Story prompt: “Imagine Sam returned to their favorite café—how would this feature make that memory feel different?”

Expected outputs:

- 12–20 divergent idea snippets tied to random stimuli
- 2 chosen metaphors with 3–5 mapped features each
- 2 prioritized feature concepts with short user stories and next-step actions

How this maps to your project (image + location memory):

- Random stimulation surfaces unconventional affordances (e.g., playful geo-badges, sensory overlays, surprise discovery triggers). Example: Random card “lantern” → feature: “Nightlight” mode that surfaces photos taken at dusk at nearby places with warm-tone filter and timeline grouping.
- Metaphor mapping ensures these affordances fit into a coherent product narrative (memory-map vs. scrapbook vs. journal), guiding UI language and retention mechanics.

Variations & follow-ups:

- Solo asynchronous version: run random-stim generation in-app with users contributing one idea each; cluster later.
- Mobile micro-session: reduce to 20 minutes—3 random cards, 1 metaphor, 1 prototype idea.
- Cross-user mashup: use crowd-sourced metaphors from early beta users to align product voice.

Deliverables I can produce now (choose):

- A facilitator script with time cues and exact read-aloud text
- 3 prototype feature concepts (wireframe notes + user stories) derived from the chosen metaphor
- A short mock copy for the app’s onboarding that uses the selected metaphor language

Reply which deliverable you want (script / prototypes / onboarding / none) or ask for another variation.

### Facilitator Script: Random Stimulation + Metaphor Mapping (Ready-to-run)

Overview: 45–75 minutes. Follow exact read-aloud wording and time cues below. Keep the session brisk during stimulation and intentionally reflective during metaphor mapping.

Materials (reminder): random word/image generator or 30-word deck, whiteboard or Miro, sticky notes/digital cards, timer.

Opening (2 minutes)

- Read aloud: "Welcome — we're running a rapid creative session to discover surprising feature ideas for a location-based memory app. Rules: no criticism, say 'yes and' to ideas, write fast, and prioritize discovery over polish."
- Read aloud: "Goal: turn surprising associations into two coherent product metaphors with prototypeable features."

Warm-up (3 minutes)

- Read aloud: "Quick warm-up: on a scale from 1–5, how comfortable are you with weird ideas? Say your number out loud." (1 minute)
- Read aloud: "Great — now one practice round: I'll show a random image/word and you shout one playful association in 10 seconds." (2 minutes)

Random Stimulation Round (15 minutes)

- Facilitator: display 6 random cards in a row.
- Read aloud: "We have six random prompts. For each prompt, silently write 2 quick ideas for how that prompt could suggest a location-based feature. You'll have 60 seconds per prompt. After 60s, we'll do a 30-second rapid share."
- Timer: 6 × (60s write + 30s share) = 9 minutes writing + 4.5 minutes sharing (round as needed to total ~15m).
- During shares: capture each idea on a sticky note and mark which prompt generated it.

Rapid Clustering (10 minutes)

- Read aloud: "Place your notes on the board. We'll cluster for 6 minutes into themes that map to user journey stages: capture, annotate, revisit, share. Then I'll highlight three promising clusters."
- Facilitator action: cluster, narrate reasoning aloud while grouping (example: "These three notes all suggest location-led discovery, I'll group them under 'Place Discovery'.").

Metaphor Mapping — Choose 2 metaphors (15 minutes)

- Read aloud: "Now we'll shape the clusters into metaphors. I propose two candidate metaphors: 1) 'Memory Map' — a geography-first scrapbook, 2) 'Travel Journal' — narrative-first entries. If you prefer different metaphors, shout them now. We'll pick two and explore each for 7 minutes."
- For each metaphor (7 minutes each):
  - Read aloud to group: "Define this metaphor in one sentence. Then take 3 minutes to convert the top cluster ideas into feature ideas that fit this metaphor (3–5 features). Write one short user story per feature: Persona + Situation + Benefit."
  - Timer: 3 minutes ideation + 3 minutes group synthesis + 1 minute readouts.

Feature Prioritization & Selection (8 minutes)

- Read aloud: "We'll now pick the top features to prototype. Each person has 2 votes — place your dots on the features you think are highest in novelty × feasibility."
- Facilitator action: tally votes, call top 2 features per metaphor (or top 2 overall) and capture them as candidate prototypes.

Wrap & Next Steps (2–5 minutes)

- Read aloud: "Great work. We've chosen the features to prototype. Please state one next action you can take in the next 24–72 hours for these features (sketch, prototype, user test). I'll record commitments now." (collect quick commitments)
- Read aloud: "I'll save the session notes and add short specs for the selected features: purpose, user story, success metric, next step."

Facilitator Scripts — Exact Read-Aloud Prompts (copy/paste)

- Opening: "Welcome — we're running a rapid creative session to discover surprising feature ideas for a location-based memory app. Rules: no criticism, say 'yes and' to ideas, write fast, and prioritize discovery over polish. Our goal is to turn surprising associations into two coherent product metaphors with prototypeable features."
- Warm-up prompt: "How comfortable are you with weird ideas? Say your number out loud. Now I'll show a quick word/image; shout one association in 10 seconds."
- Random round start: "We'll do six random prompts. For each prompt, silently write two ideas in 60 seconds for how it could map to a location-based feature. After 60 seconds, we'll do a 30-second rapid share—one idea per person. Go!"
- Clustering prompt: "Place your notes on the board and we'll cluster them by journey stage: capture, annotate, revisit, share. I'll pick three clusters that look promising for productization."
- Metaphor introduction: "From these clusters, let's pick two metaphors to shape product language. I suggest 'Memory Map' and 'Travel Journal' — any other options before we lock our two? We'll explore each for seven minutes."
- Metaphor work prompt: "Define the metaphor in one sentence. Then convert cluster ideas into 3–5 metaphor-specific features and write a one-line user story per feature: persona, situation, benefit. You have 3 minutes — go."
- Prioritization prompt: "You have two votes — mark the features that combine novelty and feasibility. Top-voted features will be our prototypes."
- Commitments prompt: "Say one small next action you will take in the next 24–72 hours to move the chosen features forward."

Recording & Artifacts (what to save)

- Save clustered board, raw idea notes, chosen metaphors, prioritized features, and user stories. Add to session document: feature title, user story, success metric (simple), next step owner and due date.

Quick Troubleshooting

- If group stalls during random round: "Pick any prompt and force one absurd mapping — absurdity often unlocks concrete ideas."
- If debate drags: "Park that discussion on a 'parking' area and continue — we'll return during prioritization if needed."

Asynchronous / Remote Notes

- Use a shared board. Run the same timeboxes, have participants drop notes during the 60s windows, then run synchronous clustering.

End of script.

Deliverable status: facilitator script appended. Reply if you want me to produce: `prototype concepts`, `wireframes`, or `onboarding copy` next.

## Live Session — Random Stimulation Round (Prompts & Response Instructions)

We're starting the live application of the script. Below are the 6 random prompts for this round. For each prompt: silently write 2 quick ideas for how the prompt could map to a location-based feature, then paste your ideas here using the format shown.

Random Prompts:

1. Lantern
2. Echo
3. Postcard
4. Compass
5. Sticker
6. Window

How to submit your ideas (copy/paste and fill):

Prompt 1 — Lantern

- Idea A:
- Idea B:

Prompt 2 — Echo

- Idea A:
- Idea B:

...and so on for all 6 prompts.

Timing guidance (optional): try 60s per prompt for ideation and 30s for rapid-share; but proceed at your pace — paste your answers when ready.

After you paste ideas for all prompts, I'll cluster them and guide the Metaphor Mapping step.

## Collected Ideas (submitted)

Prompt 1 — Lantern

- Idea A: turn on the light to light up the image with an action like guess the location for reminding
- Idea B: light a lantern as a mark that worth remembering - sharing to your friends with notify

Prompt 2 — Echo

- Idea A: A place timeline that plays layered memories from different dates, fading in and out like echoes.
- Idea B: send voice to the photos

Prompt 3 — Postcard

- Idea A: send pics to self in the future, and unlock it when you revisit or meet the deadline
- Idea B: get postcard as an achievement, milestones when visiting new places, or visit the place many times or meet your friends

Prompt 4 — Compass

- Idea A: A memory compass that points users toward places with unfinished stories (only one photo, no note, long time ago)
- Idea B: Directional browsing: swipe north/south/east/west to explore memories based on geographic orientation.

Prompt 5 — Sticker

- Idea A: attach sticker to the images/posts or even comment when it reach conditions (daily streak upload, hard fans,...)
- Idea B: use as tags

Prompt 6 — Window

- Idea A: see your friend through memory window
- Idea B: memory window to show/summary your images in a period of time

## Clustering — Emergent Themes

- Reminders & Highlights: Lantern ideas → place highlights, 'mark to remember', shareable reminders/notifications.
- Temporal Playback & Rich Media: Echo ideas → layered place timelines, audio attached to photos.
- Time-locked Memories & Achievements: Postcard ideas → future-self postcards, milestone badges for visits.
- Navigation & Discovery: Compass ideas → memory compass, directional geographic browsing.
- Tags & Social Signals: Sticker ideas → expressive stickers as tags/conditions, social signaling for achievements.
- Social Windows & Summaries: Window ideas → friend-perspective windows and period-summary views.

## Metaphor Mapping (two metaphors)

1. Memory Map (geography-first metaphor)

- Core idea: Places are the primary anchors; the map surfaces pins that expand into curated moment-views.
- Mapped features from clusters:
  - Nightlight Overlays (Lantern): warm overlays for dusk/dawn photos and highlighted places.
  - Echo Timeline: place-level layered playback of memories with audio fade-ins.
  - Place Hub: achievements (postcards/stickers), top moments, and friend windows for each location.
  - Memory Compass: points to places needing attention (unfinished stories).

2. Travel Journal (narrative-first metaphor)

- Core idea: Users compose narrative entries tied to visits; entries can be time-locked and gifted to future selves.
- Mapped features from clusters:
  - Postcard Letters: time-locked messages/photos that unlock on revisit or after a deadline.
  - Voice Notes on Photos (Echo): attach spoken memories to images as rich annotations.
  - Sticker Tags: expressive stickers used like journal tags and achievement markers.
  - Memory Window: period-summary pages (week/month) that read like journal chapters.

## Prototype Candidates (prioritized)

Selected by facilitator (novelty × feasibility):

1. Memory Compass (Navigation & Discovery) — Prototype 1

- What: A compass UI that directs users to places with 'unfinished stories' (e.g., single-photo visits, old places without notes). Tapping a compass target opens the Place Hub to complete the memory.
- User story: As a returning user, I want a quick way to find places I haven't fully documented so I can add notes and preserve the memory.
- Success metric: % of 'unfinished' places that receive a new annotation within 7 days of discovery.
- Next step: sketch compass UI and Place Hub flow.

2. Time-locked Postcards (Postcard Letters) — Prototype 2

- What: Users compose a postcard (photo + note) sent to their future self or friends; it unlocks when the user revisits the place or on a chosen date.
- User story: As someone who wants to capture intention, I want to send a photo-letter to my future self that opens when I return, so the memory feels like a gift.
- Success metric: % of postcards opened on revisit and engagement rate with unlocked postcards.
- Next step: write brief spec (fields: recipient, unlock condition, message, photo) and simple timeline for prototype.

Optional high-value idea to consider (backup): Echo Timeline (layered audio/photo playback per place) — useful for rich revisit experiences; can be combined with Place Hub.

## Immediate Next Actions (facilitator recommendations)

- Create quick sketches for `Memory Compass` and `Time-locked Postcards` (owner: product / 24–48h).
- Draft two short specs (purpose, user story, success metric, acceptance) and add to session document (owner: facilitator / 48–72h).
- Optionally run a small user test scenario with 5 users to validate emotional response to 'postcard unlock' and 'compass' guidance.

## Save & Update

I will append these outputs into the session document and mark session steps as completed.

## Quick Wireframe Notes

Memory Compass — Wireframe Notes

- Entry: Floating compass button on home map / timeline screen (bottom-right). Icon: simple compass needle.
- Compass overlay: radial view showing 3 nearest 'unfinished' places with distance and tiny thumbnail; needle points to primary suggestion.
- Tap target: opens Place Hub (full-screen) with photos, existing notes, quick-add annotation button, 'Mark complete' action.
- Place Hub layout: header with place name + revisit count, media grid (photos sorted by date), audio snippets, stickers/achievements banner, CTA to add note/photo.
- Microinteractions: subtle pulse on compass when new unfinished places appear; breadcrumb back to map.

Time-locked Postcards — Wireframe Notes

- Compose screen: photo picker + short message + recipient (self or friend) + unlock condition (date or revisit location checkbox) + optional PIN.
- Postcard card in timeline/map: locked state shows blurred thumbnail, lock icon, and hint ("Opens on revisit" or date). Unlocked expands to full message view.
- Notification flow: user receives gentle notification when postcard unlocks (with preview and CTA to open). Option to share/unlock manually if target met.
- Settings: manage scheduled postcards, drafts, and privacy controls.

## Short Spec Cards

Memory Compass — Spec Card

- Purpose: Surface places with incomplete memories and encourage users to complete documentation for richer revisit experiences.
- User story: As a returning user, I want a quick way to find places I haven't fully documented so I can add notes and preserve the memory.
- Success metric: % of surfaced 'unfinished' places that receive user annotations within 7 days (target: 15% in pilot).
- Acceptance criteria:
  1. Compass shows up on map and lists at least 1 unfinished place when such places exist.
  2. Tapping a compass suggestion opens the Place Hub for that place.
  3. Place Hub allows adding a text note and photo and persists them to the place record.
  4. 'Mark complete' removes the place from unfinished listings.

Time-locked Postcards — Spec Card

- Purpose: Let users send themselves or others time-locked memory messages that unlock on revisit or on a set date, creating emotionally resonant rediscovery moments.
- User story: As someone who wants to capture intention, I want to send a photo-letter to my future self that opens when I return, so the memory feels like a gift.
- Success metric: % of postcards unlocked on revisit/date that are opened by recipients (target: 40% open rate within 7 days of unlock).
- Acceptance criteria:
  1. Users can compose a postcard with photo, message, recipient, and unlock condition (date OR revisit location).
  2. Postcard is stored in locked state and displayed as locked card in timeline/map with correct unlock condition shown.
  3. When unlock condition is met, postcard transitions to unlocked state and notifies recipient with preview.
  4. Recipient can open postcard to view full message and optionally share or save content.
