# Epic 0 Retrospective: Project Architecture & Module Setup

**Date:** 2025-12-20
**Status:** Completed
**Facilitator:** Scrum Master Agent

## Executive Summary

Epic 0 has successfully established the foundational architecture for the **se122-image-sharing-social-media** project. All planned modules (Common, Auth, Media, Memories, Postcards, Social, Moderation, Admin) have been scaffolded with their respective `module-setup` stories. The project structure is aligned with the NestJS + TypeORM or Prisma (preferable) + Clean Architecture principles defined in the context.

## 📊 Epic Statistics

- **Total Stories:** 9 (0-0 to 0-8)
- **Completion Status:**
  - **Done:** 1 (0-8)
  - **Review:** 8 (0-0 to 0-7)
  - **Backlog:** 0
- **Validation Coverage:** 100% (All stories have associated validation reports)
- **Code Reviews:** 100% (All stories have associated code review reports)

## ✅ What Went Well (Success Factors)

1.  **Comprehensive Scaffolding:** success in breaking down the monolith into distinct, manageable modules (Auth, Media, Core, etc.) right from the start.
2.  **High Quality Assurance:** Every single story underwent both an automated validation checks and a code review process, ensuring a high standard of initial code quality.
3.  **Consistent Architecture:** The use of shared artifacts (Common module) and consistent patterns (DTOs, Entities, Controllers, Services) across all modules is evident.
4.  **Admin Module Completion:** Story 0-8 (Admin) reaching 'done' status provides a crucial management layer early in the lifecycle.

## 🚧 Challenges & Bottlenecks

1.  **Review Bottleneck:** 8 out of 9 stories are sitting in `review`. This indicates a potential bottleneck in the merge/approval process.
    - *Risk:* Building Epic 1 on top of unmerged Epic 0 code could lead to integration conflicts if changes are requested during review.
2.  **Environment Setup:** As with any greenfield project, initial environment configuration (DB connections, S3/Cloudinary mocks/credentials) likely consumed significant effort.

## 💡 Lessons Learned & Action Items

### 1. Process Improvements
- **Action:** Expedite the merge of stories 0-0 through 0-7. Do not proceed too deep into Epic 2 until the core foundation (Epic 0) is fully merged to `main`.
- **Reason:** To prevent "integration hell" where new features conflict with refactors requested in the foundation.

### 2. Technical Adjustments
- **Action:** Ensure `CommonModule` is strictly "common" and doesn't become a dumping ground. Review dependencies regularly.
- **Action:** Verify `MediaModule` performance early (Decision 10/11) as it is a dependency for Profile (Epic 1) and Core (Epic 2).

### 3. Next Epic Readiness (Epic 1)
- **Status:** **Ready**.
- The foundation (Auth Module structure, User Entity scaffolding) created in Epic 0 is sufficient for Epic 1 work to proceed parallel to the final reviews of Epic 0.

## 🎯 Conclusion

Epic 0 was a success in terms of structured output and adherence to architectural guidelines. The project is well-positioned for feature development. The immediate focus must be clearing the "Review" column to solidify the foundation.
